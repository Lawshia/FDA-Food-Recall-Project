# FDA-Food-Recall-Project
Our project aims to unveil intricate patterns in FDA recall data through a comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan. Leveraging the rich FDA Open Website data, we're poised to uncover impactful insights. Our primary goals encompass exploring recall trends across states, categorizing major recall types, and gaining deep understanding of recall reasons. 

To achieve this, we'll meticulously pre-process text data, including cleansing, stop word removal, and tokenization. Employing advanced techniques, we'll utilize Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for vectorization, paving the way for insightful analysis. We'll delve into clustering and labelling to unveil hidden patterns within the recall reasons.

Our approach emphasizes inclusivity, encompassing the entire FDA recall dataset while applying rigorous exclusion criteria to ensure data quality. The final touch will involve creating interactive Tableau dashboards, designed for user-friendly exploration, enriched by visual storytelling to guide users through our findings.

This project promises to illuminate critical insights, contributing to better comprehension of FDA recall dynamics and facilitating informed decision-making.
